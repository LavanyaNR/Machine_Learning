# Polynomial-Regression-Project-Predicting-House-Prices-Based-on-Area

We used Polynomial Regression to predict house prices from area.

Linear Regression failed to fit the data well (high error).

Polynomial Regression (degree 2) captured the curve better.

Evaluated performance using MSE and RÂ² score.
